**DNI**

Kins/Skins of Caesar Zeppeli, Risotto Nero, and/or Trish Una [JJBA]. 

Under 17.

If you cause or start drama.

**BYI**

I don't make friends on this game anymore, chatting is fine, but don't expect a furthering in relationship.

I don't care about any of your petty drama, go find someone else who does.

I often refer to my kins as 'irl'. I don't fake any disorders.

I hide all defaults for 24hrs, if you're hidden by me, that's probably why. Feel free to ask me to unhide.

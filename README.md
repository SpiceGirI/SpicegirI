**Do Not Interact**

Kins/Skins of Caesar Zeppeli, Risotto Nero, Trish Una [JJBA] and/or Muichiro Tokito [KNY]. 

Under 17.

If you cause or start drama.

**Before You Interact**

I don't mind anyone sitting with me. I won't yell at you for it like others do. 

I am usually up for chatting, but I get tired of conversing easily, I will let you know when I wish to stop.

I don't care about any of your petty drama, go find someone else who does.

I will be upfront and tell you if I don't want to speak.

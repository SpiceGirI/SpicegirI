**Do Not Interact**

Kins/Skins of Caesar Zeppeli, Risotto Nero, and/or Trish Una [JJBA]. 

Under 17.

If you cause or start drama.

**Before You Interact**

I don't mind anyone sitting with me. I won't yell at you for it like others do. Just Please ask first.

I'm not interested in making friends on PT anymore, chatting is fine, but don't expect a furthering in relationship.

I don't care about any of your petty drama, go find someone else who does.

I will be upfront and tell you if I don't want to speak.

<p align="center"> DO NOT INTERACT
<p align="center"> Kins of Caesar Zeppeli, Risotto Nero, Trish Una [JJBA] and/or Muichiro Tokito [KNY]. 
<p align="center"> Anyone under 17, I am an adult, I don't see a reason for me to befriend children.
<p align="center"> If you cause or start drama. I don't care about any of your petty drama, go find someone else who does.
<p align="center"> If you have TT/TD in your name, I won't go out of my way to harass you, but if you ask me to move, I will not.
<p align="center"> Extreme Anti-Shippers or Pro-Shippers. I do not care about this debate, and no, I am not 'neutral' in this topic.
<p align="center"> If you claim to be (self)diagnosed with Psychosis or DID. I cannot confirm or deny whether you are faking, so I rather not converse.

<p align="center"> ㅤㅤ

<p align="center"> BEFORE YOU INTERACT
<p align="center"> I don't mind anyone sitting with me. I won't yell at you for it like others do. If I am with friend(s), ask me first.
<p align="center"> I am usually up for chatting, but I get tired of conversing easily, I will let you know when I wish to stop.
<p align="center"> If you cover me or my friends I will cover you too. It's not a 'TT thing', we just want to see our skins. :)
<p align="center"> I am an adult, if you're underage, do not make suggestive jokes to me and/or about my skins, I will hide you (24hr).

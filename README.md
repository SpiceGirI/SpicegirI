Under 17.

 If you cause or start drama.

PT Info

I used to care about how my skins look but I barely play this game anymore so they're effortless on purpose.

I don't make friends on this game anymore, chatting is fine, but don't expect a furthering in relationship.

I don't care about any past drama you may have forcefully involved me in. If you're still obsessed with it 2 years later, please, I implore you to seek help.

<p align="center"> DO NOT INTERACT
<p align="center"> Kins of Caesar Zeppeli, Risotto Nero, Trish Una [JJBA], Gyomei Himejima and/or Muichiro Tokito [KNY]. 
<p align="center"> Anyone under 17, I am an adult, I don't see a reason for me to befriend children.
<p align="center"> If you cause or start drama. I don't care about any of your petty drama, go find someone else who does.

<p align="center"> ㅤㅤ

<p align="center"> BEFORE YOU INTERACT
<p align="center"> I don't mind anyone sitting with me. I won't yell at you for it like others do. If I am with friend(s), ask me first.
<p align="center"> I am usually up for chatting, but I get tired of conversing easily, I will let you know when I wish to stop.
<p align="center"> If you cover me or my friends I will cover you too. It's not a 'TT thing', we just want to see our skins. :)
<p align="center"> I'm AFK or Off-Tab often, if you try to speak to me and I don't respond, I did not see your message.
